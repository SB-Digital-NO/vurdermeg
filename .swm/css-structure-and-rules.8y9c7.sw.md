## Rules

1.  Use SCSS for editing styles. Never edit the compiled css files directly.
    
2.  SCSS rules are organised in separate files, each encapsulating a block and its related elements and modifiers (see BEM), and imported into the main styles.scss file, which in turn is compiled into the main styles.css stylesheet.
    
    1.  Separate files are _modules._
        
    2.  Modules are named using a prefixed underscore, ie. _\_cards.scss._ This tells the compiler to ignore the module.
        
    3.  Modules are imported with **@use _module_** in the _styles.scss_ file.
        
    4.  Modules are stored either in the _/baseline_ directory, for global rules, or the _/custom_ directory, for localised rules.
        
3.  Use baseline CSS classes as often as possible.
    
4.  Follow the BEM style-guide rules of naming and utilisation.
    
5.  The box-sizing property of **all** elements is set to border-box, meaning margins, padding and borders are included in size properties.
    

## BEM

### Blocks

A block is an entity that is meaningful on its own.

### Elements

### Modifiers
